## Instructions

- Use A/D or Left/Right Arrows to balance as you climb the tree. 
- Collect acorns to boost your score.
- Be sure to dodge spiders!

## Tips

- It's supposed to be hard!
- Try tapping lightly on the arrow keys instead of holding them down for small adjustments
- The balance bar gets more sensitive as the squirrel increases speed.
- Listen to what the squirrel says, they will give hints to what's about to happen.
- Total score = number of seconds survived + (10 * numbers of acorns collected)
